Hi, I'm Thyago! I'm a curious person who really loves technology. I see technology, if managed responsibly, as a way to make our world more democratic and accessible.

As a self-taught person who is interested in science, I'm always learning something. Mathematics, physics, biology and philosophy have special places in my heart. Although my real passion is software development and problem solving.

I am a black person born in Brazil. Currently I see myself as a collaborator in this immense world of computing. I study at the Federal University of Campina Grande, in the [Computer Science course](https://www.computacao.ufcg.edu.br/).
