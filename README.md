Hi, I'm Thyago! I'm a curious person who really loves technology. I see technology, if managed responsibly, as a way to make our world more democratic and accessible.

As a self-taught person who is interested in science, I'm always learning something. Mathematics, physics, biology and philosophy have special places in my heart. Although my real passion is software development and problem solving.

I am a black person born in Brazil. Currently I see myself as a collaborator in this immense world of computing. I study at the Federal University of Campina Grande, in the [Computer Science course](https://www.computacao.ufcg.edu.br/).

### Areas of interest
- Data structures, analysis and proof of algorithms.
- Functional and dynamic programming. 
- Concurrent programming and distributed systems
- Migration and scalability of systems.
- Math and problem-solving in general.

### Currently
- Working on a thesis on automated code generation.
- A nutritional tracking app. 

### Readings
- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://www.amazon.com.br/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Abelson/dp/0262510871/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=structure+and+interpretation+of+computer+programs&qid=1665408527&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjc0IiwicXNhIjoiMS4zMiIsInFzcCI6IjAuNzcifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=stru%2Caps%2C572&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.4bb5663b-6f7d-4772-84fa-7c7f565ec65b) a classic.
- [Algoritms](https://www.amazon.com.br/Algoritmos-Teoria-Pr%C3%A1tica-Thomas-Cormen/dp/8535236996/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_pt_BR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=IZ5EXTG51B8Z&keywords=algoritmos&qid=1670028643&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI0LjE1IiwicXNhIjoiMy41NiIsInFzcCI6IjMuNjcifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=algoritmos%2Caps%2C177&sr=8-3&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.fcd6d665-32ba-4479-9f21-b774e276a678) this book by Thomas H. Cormen is a bibble on the subject, always good to reed.  

### Programming Languages
I am a person who has no preferences in this matter. I believe that the scope of the problem should be the main factor in deciding which language to apply. However, I have outstanding experiences in the following languages.

- [Golang](https://go.dev/)
- [Java](https://www.java.com/pt-BR/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Languages
Portuguese, English.
