Hi, I'm Thyago! I'm a curious person who really loves technology. I see technology, if managed responsibly, as a way to make our world more democratic and accessible.

I am a black person born in Brazil. Currently I see myself as a collaborator in this immense world of computing. I study at the Federal University of Campina Grande, in the [Computer Science course](https://www.computacao.ufcg.edu.br/).
