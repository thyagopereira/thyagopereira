Hi, I'm Thyago! I'm a curious person who really loves technology. I see technology, if managed responsibly, as a way to make our world more democratic and accessible.

As a self-taught person who is interested in science, I'm always learning something. Mathematics, physics, biology and philosophy have special places in my heart. Although my real passion is software development and problem solving.

I am a black person born in Brazil. Currently I see myself as a collaborator in this immense world of computing. I study at the Federal University of Campina Grande, in the [Computer Science course](https://www.computacao.ufcg.edu.br/).

Currently I have been working on a personal level with studies focused on lexical analysis and compilers. However professionally I have been working on the payments infrastructure team at [@enjoei](https://www.enjoei.com.br) as a Senior Software Engineer.

### Areas of interest
- Data structures, analysis and proof of algorithms.
- Functional and dynamic programming. 
- Concurrent programming and distributed systems
- Migration and scaling of systems.
- Math, physics and problem-solving in general.
- Biology, living beings in general have extremely interesting behaviors and strategies. Understanding these behaviors gives us a new perspective on how to solve our own challenges.

### Currently
- Working on a thesis on automated code generation.
- A nutritional tracking app.
